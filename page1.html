                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Science is built upon scholarship consensus that changes over time. This raises the question of how revolutionary theories and assumptions are evaluated and accepted into the norm of science as the setting for the next scientific revolution.<br><br>Using two recently proposed metrics, we identify the novel paper with high atypicality, which models how research draws upon unusual combinations of prior research in crafting their own contributions, and evaluate recognition to novel papers by citation and disruption, which captures the degree to which a research article creates a new direction by eclipsing citations to the prior work it builds upon. Only a small fraction of papers (2.3%) are highly novel, using a strict standard of atypicality, and there are fewer novel papers over time, with a nearly threefold decrease from 3.9% in 1970 to 1.4% in 2000.  A highly novel paper indeed has a much higher chance (61.3%) to disrupt science than conventional papers (36.4%), but this recognition only comes from a distant future, making it a long shot for academic career success measured in citations--novelty increases at the cost of immediate citations and it typically takes 10 years or longer for the disruption score of a paper to stabilize. In comparison, only nearly 20% of scholars survived in academia over this long period, measured in publications. <br><br>We also provide the first computational model reformulating atypicality as the distance across the latent knowledge spaces learned by neural networks, which are trained to predict the co-citation of journals as a proxy to the socially agreed relevance between distinct fields of scientific knowledge. The evolution of this knowledge space characterizes how yesterday's novelty forms today's scientific conventions, which condition the novelty--and surprise--of tomorrow's breakthroughs. .</p>
